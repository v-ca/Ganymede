    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic may sound daunting, but - take a deep breath - it is actually quite simple; it is even one of the first things you learn as a child!\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate just how simple modular arithmetic is, let's take a look at an analog clock:\n",

    "If we count the hours starting at midnight (12:00am); we get 12:00am, 1:00am, 2:00am, ... , 10:00am, 11:00am, and when we reach 12:00 again the time \"switches\" from am to pm; then, the counting starts again; 12:00pm, 1:00pm, 2:00pm, and so forth. This illustrates the example of how we keep time $mod12$ - as opposed to US military time, which is kept in increments of $mod24$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If our plane leaves at 8:00pm and will take 10 hours to reach its destination, what time will we arrive (note: do not need to take into account the possibility of timezone changes)?\n",
    "Answer: 6:00am - \n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic plays a central role at the heart of many cryptographic ciphers. When preforming addition and multiplication on the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}_{m}$, from 0 to m-1 and reducing each sum or product mod m is called ***modular arithmetic***.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[$\\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ means mod5 \\]:<br>\n",
    "For example, in $\\mathbb{Z}_{5}$, $4+3=2$, $(4+3)mod5=2 \\rightarrow (7)mod5=2$; 5 goes into 7 one time with a remainder of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing the explaination, we can prove:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given d, d$\\neq$0, and a$\\geq$0, we compute numbers $q_{n}$ and $r_{n}$ such that satisfy $a=q_{n}d+r_{n}$; where $r_{n}\\geq 0$. $q_{n}$ is the ***provisional quotient*** and $r_{n}$ is the corresponding ***provisional remainder***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $q_{0}$=0 and $r_{0}$=a. Then, $a=q_{0}d+r = 0(d)+a$. Now, assuming $q_{n}$ and $r_{n}$ satisfies $a=q_{n}d+r_{n}$, we define $q_{n+1}$ and $r_{n+1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "case 1: $0\\leq r_{n} < d$. In that case, $r_{n}$ is the remainder and $q_{n}$ is the quotient. There is no $q_{n+1}$ or $r_{n+1}$ in this case.<br>\n",
    "case 2: $r_{n}\\leq d$. In that case, $r_{n}$ is too large. So, we can move a $d$: $a=q_{n}d+r_{n}=(q_{n}+1)d+(r_{n}-d)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we define $q_{n+1}=q_{n}+1$ and $r_{n+1}=r_{n}-d$. Then, $a=q_{n+1}d+r_{n+1}$. Since $r_{n}\\geq d$, $r_{n+1}\\geq 0$. If a<0, then we need to *add* d to $r_{n}$ in each step and decrease $q_{n}$ by 1. Since the initial provisional remainder is negative, this operation is done while $r_{n}<0$. "
